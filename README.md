# Diabetes-Prediction-Using-ML-Classification-Processes
This project applies machine learning classification techniques to predict the likelihood of diabetes in female patients based on diagnostic measurements from the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset. The goal is to identify high-risk individuals by training models on medical features like glucose level, BMI, insulin levels, and more.
